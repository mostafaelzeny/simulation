# ðŸ¤– Robot URDF Simulation in RViz

This project contains a **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)** model of a robotic arm designed for visualization and simulation in **RViz** using **ROS 2 Humble**.

---

## ðŸ§© Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a realistic 3D representation of a robotic arm that can be visualized and tested in RViz.  
The robot is described using URDF and Xacro files, and it includes visual, collision, and joint configurations.

This simulation is useful for:
- Understanding robot kinematics and structure
- Testing TF frames and joint limits
- Visualizing control or sensor integration in ROS 2
